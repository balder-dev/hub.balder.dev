`Balder <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_ is a Python test framework that allows you to reuse test code youâ€™ve written once
across different platforms, devices, or applications. You can install ready-to-use tests, so called
**BalderHub Packages**, to evaluate all kinds of end-user devices/applications - without reinventing the wheel.

This page gives an overview over all BalderHub packages that are contained in the
`balder-dev GitHub group <https://github.com/balder-dev>`_.
