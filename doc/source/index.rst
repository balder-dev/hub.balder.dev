   Balder Documentation <https://docs.balder.dev>

`Balder <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_ is a Python test framework that allows you to reuse test code youâ€™ve written once
across different platforms, devices, or applications. You can install ready-to-use tests, so called
**BalderHub Packages**, to evaluate all kinds of end-user devices/applications - without reinventing the wheel.

This page gives an overview over all BalderHub packages that are contained in the
`balder-dev GitHub group <https://github.com/balder-dev>`_. If you are new to Balder, checkout
`the documentation <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_.

.. note::

    We are just at the beginning.

    Do you know one area really well? Do you like the concept of Balder? Think about initiating your own BalderHub
    project. Take a look at our `Balder GitHub Group <https://github.com/balder-dev>`_ and feel free to contribute to
    an existing project or create your own. If you're not sure whether your topic already exists or if you're looking
    for colleagues to develop a BalderHub project together as a group, feel free to
    `create an issue <https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/issues>`_ or
    `start a new discussion <https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/discussions>`_.

    If you want to add your package to `the BalderHub projects <https://hub.balder.dev>`_, just ask for help by
    creating an issue in `the main hub project <https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/issues>`_.
