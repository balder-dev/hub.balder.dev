Develop own BalderHub project
*****************************

Balder is still in its early steps. Unfortunately, this also means that we don't have a broad variety of BalderHub
projects at the moment.

Are you an expert in your field? Do you enjoy the concept of Balder? How about you create your own BalderHub project?
Take a look into our `Balder GitHub Group <https://github.com/balder-dev>`_ and feel free to share your ideas. You can
contribute to an existing project or create your own one. If you are not sure, a project for your idea already exists
or if you want to discuss your ideas with others, feel free to
`create an issue in the BalderHub main entry project <https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/issues>`_ or
`start a new discussion <https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/discussions>`_.

.. warning::
    Please note: We are currently developing the
    `Part 7 - Develop and use BalderHub packages <https://docs.balder.dev/en/latest/tutorial_guide/07_convert_in_balderhub.html>`_
    of the tutorial series. Here you will find more information soon. For now, you can also take a look at the existing
    `BalderHub package for SNMP-Agents at GitHub <https://github.com/balder-dev/balderhub-snmpagent>`_.
